      "\" We would like to update and improve on their work, by using the more recent SDSS data reductions to make both the color images as well as scientifically calibrated image mosaics for each galaxy in the RC3 catalog that lies within the SDSS footprint.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Most likely we will develop a Python program to call Montage iteratively on the data needed to build each RC3 galaxy that lies with in the SDSS footprint. We will then build a color image by using STIFF. This project is not conceptually difficult, but doing right will take patience and good record-keeping. All files will eventually be served off the LCDM website.\n",
